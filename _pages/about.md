Raised in San Antonio Texas, Alexander M. Wetter is a student attending high school, who made this website as his final project. Mr. Wetter intends to pursue a career in Cybersecurity. 

This website is intended as a status page, of sorts. It will allow people to coordinate events with a person, as well as allow a person to have a public image that is easily accessible to everyone. I took liberty with the term "Personal Assistant", and made it more like a personal status sheet.

This Website has an API to pull publications from one of my favorite scientists, Albert Einstien. It is then formatted to make it look better, visually. This website has many more features, that I will explain.
